# PokeInfo-App

This app is designed to provide basic information about a specific Pokemon based on information stored within a Pokemon API. 

PokeAPI link- https://pokeapi.co/

A specific Pokemon can be searched through a search bar and the type, what held items it has on capture, and what Pokemon game versions it will appear in will be returned. 

JavaScript must be enabled, and all files must be cloned in order to view the app.
